## Problem

There is an array of $n$ integers. There are also $2$ **disjoint sets**, $A$ and $B$, each containing $m$ integers. You like all the integers in set $A$ and dislike all the integers in set $B$. Your initial happiness is $0$. For each $i$ integer in the array, if $i\in A$, you add $1$ to your happiness. If $i\in B$, you add $-1$ to your happiness. Otherwise, your happiness does not change. Output your final happiness at the end.  

**Note:** Since $A$ and $B$ are sets, they have no repeated elements. However, the array might contain duplicate elements.  

**Constraints**  
$1\le n\le 10^5$  
$1\le m\le 10^5$  
$1\le Any\ integer\ in\ the\ input\le 10^9$  

**Input Format**

The first line contains integers $n$ and $m$ separated by a space.  
The second line contains $n$ integers, the elements of the array.  
The third and fourth lines contain $m$ integers, $A$ and $B$, respectively.

**Output Format**

Output a single integer, your total happiness.

```py
input()
n = list(map(int, input().split()))

set_a = set(map(int, input().split()))
set_b = set(map(int, input().split()))

print(sum((i in set_a) - (i in set_b) for i in n))

```
